# AI Ops Console â€“ Technical Task Checklist

## Backend Infrastructure

### 1. Microservices Architecture
- [ ] Design and implement microservices for:
  - [ ] User authentication and management
  - [ ] AI component management
  - [ ] Workflow orchestration
  - [ ] Execution monitoring
- [ ] Set up API Gateway for routing and security
- [ ] Integrate message queue (Kafka or RabbitMQ) for async communication
- [ ] Implement distributed caching (Redis)

### 2. Database Strategy
- [ ] Design relational schema in PostgreSQL for:
  - [ ] User data
  - [ ] Component metadata
  - [ ] Workflow definitions
- [ ] Integrate vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate) for AI component similarity search
- [ ] Set up Redis for caching and session management

### 3. Security & Authentication
- [ ] Implement OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect
- [ ] Add JWT token management (expiration, refresh)
- [ ] Enforce role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Add audit trails and session management
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

### 4. API Development
- [ ] Develop RESTful API endpoints for all core features
- [ ] Add input validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and CORS configuration
- [ ] Ensure all endpoints require authentication/authorization

### 5. Workflow Orchestration
- [ ] Integrate a production-grade orchestration engine (Temporal, Prefect, or Airflow)
- [ ] Implement workflow execution, error handling, and retries

### 6. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Set up application and infrastructure monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing (Jaeger)
- [ ] Add structured logging with correlation IDs (ELK stack or similar)
- [ ] Track AI-specific metrics (model performance, latency, accuracy)

### 7. DevOps & Infrastructure
- [ ] Containerize all services with Docker
- [ ] Set up Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI)
- [ ] Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform or Pulumi)

## Frontend Improvements

### 1. Build System & Environment
- [ ] Migrate from ESM importmap to Vite for builds and environment variable management
- [ ] Implement secure API key management

### 2. State Management
- [ ] Replace or supplement Context API with Zustand for complex state
- [ ] Optimize for real-time workflow monitoring and large state trees

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add code splitting with React.lazy
- [ ] Use React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Optimize re-renders and implement error boundaries

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests (Jest, React Testing Library)
- [ ] Add integration tests for API interactions
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests (Cypress or Playwright)
- [ ] Test AI components and workflow executions

### 5. Security & Accessibility
- [ ] Harden frontend against XSS and CSRF
- [ ] Improve accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation)

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (4-6 weeks)
- [ ] Implement basic microservices architecture
- [ ] Set up authentication and authorization systems
- [ ] Design and implement core database schema
- [ ] Develop fundamental API endpoints

### Phase 2: Core Features (6-8 weeks)
- [ ] Build component marketplace backend services
- [ ] Implement workflow definition and storage systems
- [ ] Develop basic execution engine
- [ ] Create user management interfaces

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (8-10 weeks)
- [ ] Implement AI-powered component recommendations
- [ ] Build real-time execution monitoring
- [ ] Add advanced workflow patterns and AI integrations
- [ ] Optimize performance and scalability

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (4-6 weeks)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing implementation
- [ ] Security hardening and audit
- [ ] Monitoring and observability deployment
- [ ] Documentation and production deployment

---

## Cost & Resource Considerations
- [ ] Estimate backend development time (12-16 weeks, 2-3 developers)
- [ ] Plan for operational costs ($500-2000/month depending on scale)
- [ ] Factor in cloud, third-party, and monitoring tool expenses
