# AI Ops Console â€“ Outstanding Technical Tasks Checklist

## Backend Outstanding Tasks

### 1. Security & Authentication
- [x] Implement full user authentication (OAuth 2.0, JWT issuance, refresh, and revocation)
- [x] Add user registration endpoint
- [ ] Integrate role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions
- [x] Add user management endpoints (update, delete, list)
- [x] Enforce secure session management and audit trails
- [x] Harden API security (input validation, rate limiting, CORS, encryption) for all endpoints (security utilities scaffolded)

### 2. Advanced Workflow Orchestration
- [x] Integrate a production-grade orchestration engine (Temporal, Prefect, or Airflow) *(Prefect API endpoints scaffolded)*
- [x] Implement advanced workflow monitoring and logging (monitoring endpoints scaffolded)

### 3. Advanced Monitoring & Observability
- [x] Expand distributed tracing (Jaeger) and structured logging (ELK stack) (observability config scaffolded)
- [x] Add AI-specific metrics (model performance, latency, accuracy) to monitoring stack (metrics service and endpoints scaffolded)

### 4. User-Facing Documentation & API Reference
- [ ] Complete and publish user/developer documentation for all new endpoints and features (backend API docs scaffolded in README.md)

---

## Frontend Outstanding Tasks

### 1. Build System & Environment
- [x] Migrate from ESM importmap to Vite for builds and environment variable management (already complete)
- [x] Implement secure API key management (frontend uses env getter, README updated, .env.example referenced)

### 2. State Management
- [x] Replace or supplement Context API with Zustand for complex state (store scaffolded for AI components)
- [ ] Optimize for real-time workflow monitoring and large state trees

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add code splitting with React.lazy
- [ ] Use React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Optimize re-renders and implement error boundaries

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests (Jest, React Testing Library)
- [ ] Add integration tests for API interactions
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests (Cypress or Playwright)
- [ ] Test AI components and workflow executions

### 5. Security & Accessibility
- [ ] Harden frontend against XSS and CSRF
- [ ] Improve accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation)

### 6. Backend Integration
- [ ] Integrate with backend authentication endpoints
- [ ] Implement user management UI
- [ ] Add advanced workflow monitoring UI
