# Action Logging Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the action logging functionality in the MCP Backend.

## Overview

The action logging system provides a comprehensive audit trail of all significant actions performed in the system. It tracks who performed what action on which entity, along with relevant details and timestamps.

## Components

### 1. Action Log Model (`mcp/db/models/action_log.py`)

The `ActionLog` SQLAlchemy model stores the following information:

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `timestamp`: When the action occurred
- `actor_id`: Who performed the action
- `action_type`: Type of action (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)
- `entity_type`: Type of entity affected (MCP_DEFINITION, MCP_VERSION, WORKFLOW_RUN, etc.)
- `entity_id`: ID of the affected entity
- `details`: JSONB field containing additional context about the action

### 2. Auditing Service (`mcp/core/services/auditing_service.py`)

The `AuditingService` class provides methods for creating and managing action log entries:

```python
class AuditingService:
    def create_action_log_entry(
        self,
        actor_id: str,
        action_type: ActionType,
        entity_type: EntityType,
        entity_id: int,
        details: Dict = None
    ) -> ActionLog:
        """Create a new action log entry."""
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# Create a new action log entry
auditing_service.create_action_log_entry(
    actor_id="user123",
    action_type=ActionType.CREATE,
    entity_type=EntityType.MCP_DEFINITION,
    entity_id=1,
    details={"name": "New MCP", "description": "Test MCP"}
)
```

### Integration with CRUD Operations

The action logging system is integrated with various CRUD operations:

1. **MCP Definition Operations**

   - Creating new MCP definitions
   - Updating existing definitions
   - Deleting definitions

2. **Workflow Operations**
   - Starting workflow runs
   - Updating workflow status
   - Completing workflow runs

## Testing

The action logging functionality is tested in `tests/core/test_auditing_service.py`. The test suite includes:

1. `test_create_action_log_entry`: Tests basic log entry creation
2. `test_create_action_log_entry_without_details`: Tests entry creation without details
3. `test_create_action_log_entry_with_complex_details`: Tests entry creation with complex details
4. `test_action_log_entry_retrieval`: Tests retrieving and ordering log entries
5. `test_action_log_entry_validation`: Tests input validation

## Error Handling

The action logging system includes validation for:

- Invalid action types
- Invalid entity types
- Invalid entity IDs
- Missing required fields

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the action logging system:

1. Add support for bulk action logging
2. Implement log entry filtering and search
3. Add log entry archiving functionality
4. Implement log entry retention policies
5. Add support for log entry export
6. Implement real-time log monitoring
7. Add support for log entry correlation
