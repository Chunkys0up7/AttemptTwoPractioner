# mcp/core/workflow_streaming_service.py
# This service is responsible for publishing workflow execution updates

# by the SSE streaming endpoint to send to clients.

    # This service might also handle logic for constructing specific event payloads
    # before publishing if it's more complex than what the WorkflowEngineService does directly.
