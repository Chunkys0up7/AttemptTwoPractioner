# mcp/core/security/rbac_service.py
# This file will contain the logic for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
# - Defining roles and permissions.
# - Service methods to check if a user (with certain roles) has permission
#   to perform a specific action on a resource.
# This is a placeholder for future, more detailed RBAC implementation.

# from mcp.db.models.user import User # Assuming User model has a role attribute/relationship
# from enum import Enum
# from typing import List

# class Permission(str, Enum):
#     CREATE_MCP = "create_mcp"
#     READ_MCP = "read_mcp"
#     UPDATE_MCP = "update_mcp"
#     DELETE_MCP = "delete_mcp"
#     EXECUTE_WORKFLOW = "execute_workflow"
#     # ... add more permissions

# # Define roles and their associated permissions
# ROLE_PERMISSIONS: Dict[str, List[Permission]] = {
#     "Admin": list(Permission), # Admin has all permissions
#     "Editor": [
#         Permission.CREATE_MCP, Permission.READ_MCP, Permission.UPDATE_MCP,
#         Permission.EXECUTE_WORKFLOW
#     ],
#     "Viewer": [Permission.READ_MCP],
# }

# class RBACService:
#     @staticmethod
#     def has_permission(user: User, permission: Permission) -> bool:
#         if not user or not user.role: # Assuming user.role is a string like "Admin", "Editor"
#             return False
#         user_permissions = ROLE_PERMISSIONS.get(user.role.name, []) # Adjust if user.role is not just a string
#         return permission in user_permissions

    # More advanced RBAC might involve checking ownership of resources,
    # or more granular permissions associated directly with users or groups.
    # Example:
    # def check_permission_or_raise(user: User, permission: Permission):
    #     if not RBACService.has_permission(user, permission):
    #         raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Not enough permissions")
