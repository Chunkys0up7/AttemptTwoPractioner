# mcp/components/ai_copilot_service.py
# This file will contain the backend service logic for the AI Co-Pilot feature.
# Responsibilities:
# - Receiving context from the UI (e.g., current workflow definition, selected component).
# - Interacting with an LLM (like Gemini) to generate suggestions for:
#   - Workflow optimization.
#   - Component configuration.
#   - Schema repair or mapping.
#   - Code snippets for script components.
# - Formatting suggestions for display in the UI.

# class AICoPilotService:
#     def __init__(self):
#         # self.llm_client = GeminiClient(api_key=settings.GEMINI_API_KEY) # Or other LLM
#         pass

#     async def get_workflow_optimization_suggestions(self, workflow_definition: dict) -> List[str]:
#         # Prepare prompt with workflow_definition context
#         # Call LLM
#         # Parse response and return suggestions
#         return ["Suggestion 1: Consider replacing component X with Y for better performance.", "Suggestion 2: Parallelize steps A and B."] # Placeholder

#     async def get_component_config_advice(self, component_type: str, current_config: dict) -> List[str]:
#         # Provide advice based on component type and its current configuration
#         return [f"For {component_type}, ensure parameter 'timeout' is set appropriately."] # Placeholder

    # Add more methods for other types of AI-powered assistance.
