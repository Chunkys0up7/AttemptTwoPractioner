# mcp/components/dependency_visualizer_service.py
# Backend service to generate data for the Dependency Visualizer UI.
# Responsibilities:
# - Analyzing MCP definitions and workflow definitions to identify dependencies.
# - Dependencies could be:
#   - Between MCPs within a workflow.
#   - Between different MCP versions (e.g., "version 1.1 depends on base component X v1.0").
#   - Between MCPs and external data sources (if ExternalDatabaseConfig is integrated).
# - Formatting this dependency data into a graph structure (nodes and edges)
#   suitable for rendering by a frontend library like ReactFlow or Vis.js.

#         # or external DB configs.
