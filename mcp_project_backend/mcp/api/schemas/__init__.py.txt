# This file makes the 'schemas' directory a Python sub-package.
# It's good practice to import all schema modules here to make them easily accessible.
# Example:
# from . import auth_schemas
# from . import mcp_definition_schemas
# from . import mcp_version_schemas
# # ... and so on for all schema files
