# This file makes the 'models' directory a Python sub-package.
# It should import all SQLAlchemy ORM models defined in this directory
# so they are registered with SQLAlchemy's metadata. This is important for Alembic
# and for Base.metadata.create_all() if used.

# Example:
# from .user import User, Role
# from .mcp_definition import MCPDefinition, MCPVersion
# from .workflow_definition import WorkflowDefinition, WorkflowStep
# from .workflow_run import WorkflowRun # , WorkflowRunStepLog (if defined as a separate model)
# from .action_log import ActionLog
# from .external_db_config import ExternalDatabaseConfig
# from mcp.db.base import Base # Make Base accessible if models need it directly sometimes (though usually inherited)
