# This file makes the 'crud' directory a Python sub-package.
# CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete.
# This package contains modules for interacting with database models.
# Each CRUD module is typically focused on a specific model or related models.

# Example:
# from .base_crud import CRUDBase
# from .crud_user import crud_user
# from .crud_mcp_definition import crud_mcp_definition, crud_mcp_version
# # ... and so on for all CRUD modules
