# Backend Recovery Checklist

> **Status Note (2024-06-07):**
> - Template models, CRUD, versioning, and most endpoints are implemented and marked as complete.
> - Template sharing, permissions, category management, and some endpoints are missing.
> - Performance monitoring, advanced auth features, and security enhancements are mostly missing.
> - Testing and documentation are not implemented.
