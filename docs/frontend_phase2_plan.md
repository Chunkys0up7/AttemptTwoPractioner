# Frontend Phase 2 Implementation Plan (Code-Driven)

> **Note:** This checklist is based on a deep dive into the actual codebase as of 2024-06-07. Items below reflect what is truly implemented and what remains. Backend work is complete. See `PHASE_2_CORE_FUNCTIONALITY_CHECKLIST.md` for backend status.

---

## âœ… Fully Implemented (Frontend)
- Monaco Editor is fully integrated as a reusable `CodeEditor` component
- All code/script editing areas use the Monaco-based editor
- Multi-language support (Python, TypeScript, SQL, Markdown, YAML, etc.)
- Syntax highlighting for all supported languages
- Validation/linting (inline errors/warnings, custom validation)
- Auto-completion and code snippets/templates (via `snippets` prop)
- Auto-format on save (for Monaco-supported languages)
- File upload (drag-and-drop and file picker) for code/scripts
- React Flow workflow builder is integrated with drag-and-drop, node/edge state, zoom/pan/fit controls
- Component palette and properties panel are present
- Mobile view handling is present
- Workflow validation logic exists (nodes/edges/structure)
- Documentation and devlog are up to date for these features
