# Performance Review Report

## 1. Overview

This review assesses the performance posture of the AI Ops Console as of [YYYY-MM-DD], covering backend and frontend monitoring, optimization, metrics, alerting, and resource usage. The review is based on code, configuration, and documentation in the repository.

## 2. Strengths

- **Comprehensive backend performance monitoring** (HTTP, DB, workflow, Prometheus, system health, alerting)
- **Frontend performance dashboard** with real-time metrics and reporting
- **Threshold-based alerting** for latency, error rate, memory, CPU, etc.
- **Metrics endpoints** for Prometheus, JSON summary, and dashboard
- **Performance optimization guides and checklists** (code splitting, lazy loading, caching, DB optimization, etc.)
- **Testing**: Backend performance monitoring is covered by automated tests
- **Documentation**: Performance monitoring, optimization, and best practices are well documented

## 3. Gaps / Findings

- **Frontend**: Bundle size optimization, code splitting, and lazy loading are planned but not fully implemented
- **Asset optimization**: Image and font optimization could be improved
- **Backend**: Some endpoints could benefit from additional caching and query optimization
- **Alerting**: No automated notification for performance alerts (alerts are exposed via API but not pushed)
- **Visualization**: No integrated Grafana or APM dashboards (metrics are available for integration)
- **Testing**: No automated frontend performance benchmarks (Lighthouse, Web Vitals) are run in CI
- **Retention**: Metrics are in-memory only and reset every 24 hours; no long-term retention

## 4. Recommendations

- Complete frontend bundle size optimization, code splitting, and lazy loading
- Optimize images, fonts, and static assets for faster load times
- Add/expand backend caching and query optimization for high-traffic endpoints
- Integrate automated notification for performance alerts (email, Slack, etc.)
- Integrate with Grafana/APM for advanced visualization and alerting
- Add automated frontend performance benchmarks to CI (Lighthouse, Web Vitals)
- Consider persistent storage for long-term metrics retention and analysis
- Continue to update documentation and best practices as improvements are made
