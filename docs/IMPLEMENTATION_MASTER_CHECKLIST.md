- Write tests first (TDD approach)
- Implement functionality with proper error handling
- Code review before merging
- Update documentation as needed

## Quality Standards
- Code Coverage: Minimum 80% for new code
- Performance: No regression in Core Web Vitals
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Security: Regular security audits
- Documentation: All public APIs documented
