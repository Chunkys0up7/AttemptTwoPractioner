# Security Audit Report

## 1. Overview

This audit reviews the security posture of the AI Ops Console as of [YYYY-MM-DD], covering authentication, authorization, data protection, API security, configuration, and monitoring. The review is based on code, configuration, and documentation in the repository.

## 2. Strengths

- **Comprehensive security documentation** (`security_architecture.md`, `security_enhancements.md`)
- **Security features implemented**:
  - Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
  - Rate limiting (configurable, IP-based)
  - CORS and trusted host validation
  - Session management (middleware, secure cookies)
  - API key authentication (model, service, dependency)
  - JWT token management (planned, partial)
  - Input validation and sanitization (Pydantic, config)
  - DB encryption and audit logging (configurable)
- **Security testing**: Middleware, API key routes, headers, rate limiting
- **Security best practices** documented and referenced
- **Planned enhancements**: OAuth2, RBAC, monitoring, audit logging, anomaly detection

## 3. Gaps / Findings

- **Authentication**: Mock authentication in frontend; JWT only partially implemented; no session refresh; sensitive data in localStorage
- **Authorization**: RBAC and fine-grained permissions not fully implemented
- **API Security**: Some endpoints lack authentication middleware; CORS defaults are permissive; no brute force protection; no API key rotation/expiration
- **Data Validation**: Some backend routes lack input sanitization; SQL injection potential in dynamic queries
- **Secret Management**: Hardcoded/default secrets in config; no rotation or encryption for env secrets
- **Hashing**: API key hashing uses SHA-256 (should use bcrypt/Argon2 with salt)
- **Monitoring**: No security event logging or anomaly detection in production
- **Testing**: No automated penetration tests or dynamic security scans

## 4. Recommendations

- Replace mock authentication with full JWT-based auth and session refresh
- Implement RBAC and resource-level permissions throughout backend
- Require authentication on all API endpoints; restrict CORS in production
- Add brute force protection and rate limiting to sensitive endpoints
- Use bcrypt/Argon2 with salt for API key and password hashing
- Rotate and encrypt all secrets; remove hardcoded defaults
- Add security event logging, monitoring, and anomaly detection
- Expand automated security testing (static and dynamic analysis)
- Document all changes in security docs and audit logs
